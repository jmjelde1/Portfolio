This is my group project from Software Engineering. I chose this project because it was the largest and most challenging project I have completed thus far, and it was my first time working on a long term project with a group. My group was tasked with creating a game for elementary students. We chose to create a web application that was connected to a database which stored game scores, class list, and our math questions. This gave me opportunities to self learn new skills used in software development, as well as providing an opportunity to learn what it's like to work with a team of developers, how to plan how you're going to develop software, and how to organize your work output as a team.
