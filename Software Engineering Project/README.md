This is my group project from Software Engineering. I chose this project because it was the largest and most challenging project I have completed thus far, and it was my first time working on a long term project with a group. My group chose to create a web based spelling and problem-solving game targeted at 2nd through 5th graders. This gave me opportunities to self learn new skills used in software development, as well as providing an opportunity to learn what it's like to work with a team of developers, how to plan how you're going to develop software, and how to organize your work output as a team.

This project helped me understand concepts and tecniques of software design, it gave me project experience working in a group setting, and it helped me develop effective problem solving skills, which relate to 3 out of the 4 the Westminster College Computer Science Learning goals.
