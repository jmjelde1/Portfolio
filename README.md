## SkiForce

This app makes a day on the hill more engaging by letting users look at insightful data about their run. By utilizing Swift and SwiftUI, for each run the user does on the hill they are given information on how many turns they did, average and maximum G-force, average and top speed, jump time, and length as well as total vertical descent and other GPS related metrics. The app also has a built-in machine learning model that predicts ski type based on the accelerometer data collected while skiing.

This project helped me attain a system-level understanding of the computer because it forced me to understand the underlying hardware of the phone I was coding for. It also helped me understand the concepts of object-oriented programming as Swift is a object-oriented programming language. Lastly, this project gave me significant project experience as it is a fully working iOS app that I spent two semesters working on, as well as it helped me develop effective problem solving skills.

## Slope Perception Survey Website

This is a project done in collaboration with the Westminster College Neuroscience Department with the goal of researching people's ability to judge the gradient of a slope while backcountry skiing. The page consists of two parts - the survey page and a page that let's the researcher look at all the responses collected. The researcher can also easily download a CSV file of all the responses. The survey did get approved to be sent out to 4000 skiers in the Utah area and had pending approvals for Colorado and Montana as well.

I chose this project because this was my first time working with a client where we had to deliver a working product by the end of the semester. For this project we also got to work with Communications major students that did the design of the web pages for us. This was a great learning experince that forced us to communicate despite our different fields of expertise.

This project helped me understand concepts and tecniques of software design, it gave me project experience working in a group setting, and it helped me develop effective problem solving skills, which relate to 3 out of the 4 the Westminster College Computer Science Learning goals.

## Spelling Wiz - Software Engineering

This is my group project from Software Engineering. I chose this project because it was the largest and most challenging project I have completed thus far, and it was my first time working on a long term project with a group. My group chose to create a web based spelling and problem-solving game targeted at 2nd through 5th graders. This gave me opportunities to self learn new skills used in software development, as well as providing an opportunity to learn what it's like to work with a team of developers, how to plan how you're going to develop software, and how to organize your work output as a team.

This project helped me understand concepts and tecniques of software design, it gave me project experience working in a group setting, and it helped me develop effective problem solving skills, which relate to 3 out of the 4 the Westminster College Computer Science Learning goals.

## Ski Team Inventory

Me and a partner developed an inventory management system for the Westminster Ski Team. The database tracks all the athletes skis, the brands as well as information about each skier. It has a interface that is connected to the database making it possible for the user to add, update or delete parts as they please.

I chose this project because it was my first time working with a database and it was satisfying to work on something I could use in the future. Completing this project helped me gain experience working in a team where we delegated tasks and communicated efficiently. It also gave me valuable experience in database schema and design.

## Chat Room

This project is a chat room written in Java. The programs lets the users instantly send and receive messages across a network.

I chose this project cause I think it was the most fun project to get working. Building the program step by step, and finally being able to instantly send messages to your classmates was very rewarding. Even though this was a individual assignment, we had to design the protocol as a team. This taught me how to work in a group setting as we had to discuss the pros and cons of different solutions and then make a decision on a design the entire team would follow.
