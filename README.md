### Slope Perception Survey Website

This is a project done in collaboration with the Westminster College Neuroscience Department with the goal of researching people's abaility to judge the gradient of a slope while backcountry skiing. The page consists of two parts - the survey page and a page that let's the researcher look at all the responses collected. The researcher can also easily download a CSV file of all the responses. The survey did get approved to be sent out to 4000 skiers in the Utah area and had pending approvals for Colorado and Montana as well.

I chose this project because this was my first time working with a client where we had to deliver a working product by the end of the semester. For this project we also got to work with Communications major students that did the design of the web pages for us. This was a great learning experince that forced us to communicate despite our different fields of expertise.

This project helped me understand concepts and tecniques of software design, it gave me project experience working in a group setting, and it helped me develop effective problem solving skills, which relate to 3 out of the 4 the Westminster College Computer Science Learning goals.
