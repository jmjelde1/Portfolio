            <p id="instruct">This study measures your ability to accurately perceive and identify the angle of mountain slopes, an important skill for backcountry travel and safety, especially in avalanche terrain. <br><br> You will be shown 90 images of snow-covered, mountainous slopes from a variety of viewing angles. Your task is to identify the average angle of each (with 90° being vertical and 0° being completely flat) as accurately as possible using the slider bar below each image. <br><br>The study should take approximately 20 minutes to complete, including a very brief demographic survey at its conclusion. The data will be used for research and educational purposes, so please use your best effort to estimate slope angles, as you would in a real mountain environment. <br><br>You will receive data on your own performance upon completion. Although you will have the option to provide your email address to be entered into a drawing and receive updates on the study’s overall results at its conclusion (optional), your identity will remain confidential and anonymous and will not be linked to your data or responses.
